	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The four intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer, defined by differential expression of 50 genes ({PAM}50), have been shown to be predictive of risk of recurrence and benefit of hormonal therapy and chemotherapy. Here we describe the development of Prosigna™, a {PAM}50-based subtype classifier and risk model on the {NanoString} {nCounter} Dx Analysis System intended for decentralized testing in clinical laboratories.
{METHODS}: 514 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded ({FFPE}) breast cancer patient samples were used to train prototypical centroids for each of the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer on the {NanoString} platform. Hierarchical cluster analysis of gene expression data was used to identify the prototypical centroids defined in previous {PAM}50 algorithm training exercises. 304 {FFPE} patient samples from a well annotated clinical cohort in the absence of adjuvant systemic therapy were then used to train a subtype-based risk model (i.e. Prosigna {ROR} score). 232 samples from a tamoxifen-treated patient cohort were used to verify the prognostic accuracy of the algorithm prior to initiating clinical validation studies.
{RESULTS}: The gene expression profiles of each of the four Prosigna subtype centroids were consistent with those previously published using the {PCR}-based {PAM}50 method. Similar to previously published classifiers, tumor samples classified as Luminal A by Prosigna had the best prognosis compared to samples classified as one of the three higher-risk tumor subtypes. The Prosigna Risk of Recurrence ({ROR}) score model was verified to be significantly associated with prognosis as a continuous variable and to add significant information over both commonly available {IHC} markers and Adjuvant! Online.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The results from the training and verification data sets show that the {FDA}-cleared and {CE} marked Prosigna test provides an accurate estimate of the risk of distant recurrence in hormone receptor positive breast cancer and is also capable of identifying a tumor's intrinsic subtype that is consistent with the previously published {PCR}-based {PAM}50 assay. Subsequent analytical and clinical validation studies confirm the clinical accuracy and technical precision of the Prosigna {PAM}50 assay in a decentralized setting.},
