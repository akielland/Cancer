	abstract = {The hallmarks of cancer conceptualization is a heuristic tool for distilling the vast complexity of cancer phenotypes and genotypes into a provisional set of underlying principles. As knowledge of cancer mechanisms has progressed, other facets of the disease have emerged as potential refinements. Herein, the prospect is raised that phenotypic plasticity and disrupted differentiation is a discrete hallmark capability, and that nonmutational epigenetic reprogramming and polymorphic microbiomes both constitute distinctive enabling characteristics that facilitate the acquisition of hallmark capabilities. Additionally, senescent cells, of varying origins, may be added to the roster of functionally important cell types in the tumor microenvironment.Cancer is daunting in the breadth and scope of its diversity, spanning genetics, cell and tissue biology, pathology, and response to therapy. Ever more powerful experimental and computational tools and technologies are providing an avalanche of “big data” about the myriad manifestations of the diseases that cancer encompasses. The integrative concept embodied in the hallmarks of cancer is helping to distill this complexity into an increasingly logical science, and the provisional new dimensions presented in this perspective may add value to that endeavor, to more fully understand mechanisms of cancer development and malignant progression, and apply that knowledge to cancer medicine.},

	abstract = {As modern biotechnologies advance, it has become increasingly frequent that different modalities of high-dimensional molecular data (termed “omics” data in this paper), such as gene expression, methylation, and copy number, are collected from the same patient cohort to predict the clinical outcome. While prediction based on omics data has been widely studied in the last fifteen years, little has been done in the statistical literature on the integration of multiple omics modalities to select a subset of variables for prediction, which is a critical task in personalized medicine. In this paper, we propose a simple penalized regression method to address this problem by assigning different penalty factors to different data modalities for feature selection and prediction. The penalty factors can be chosen in a fully data-driven fashion by cross-validation or by taking practical considerations into account. In simulation studies, we compare the prediction performance of our approach, called IPF-LASSO (Integrative LASSO with Penalty Factors) and implemented in the R package ipflasso, with the standard LASSO and sparse group LASSO. The use of IPF-LASSO is also illustrated through applications to two real-life cancer datasets. All data and codes are available on the companion website to ensure reproducibility.},

	abstract = {We propose a method for supervised learning with multiple sets of features (“views”). The multiview problem is especially important in biology and medicine, where “-omics” data, such as genomics, proteomics, and radiomics, are measured on a common set of samples. “Cooperative learning” combines the usual squared-error loss of predictions with an “agreement” penalty to encourage the predictions from different data views to agree. By varying the weight of the agreement penalty, we get a continuum of solutions that include the well-known early and late fusion approaches. Cooperative learning chooses the degree of agreement (or fusion) in an adaptive manner, using a validation set or cross-validation to estimate test set prediction error. One version of our fitting procedure is modular, where one can choose different fitting mechanisms (e.g., lasso, random forests, boosting, or neural networks) appropriate for different data views. In the setting of cooperative regularized linear regression, the method combines the lasso penalty with the agreement penalty, yielding feature sparsity. The method can be especially powerful when the different data views share some underlying relationship in their signals that can be exploited to boost the signals. We show that cooperative learning achieves higher predictive accuracy on simulated data and real multiomics examples of labor-onset prediction. By leveraging aligned signals and allowing flexible fitting mechanisms for different modalities, cooperative learning offers a powerful approach to multiomics data fusion.},

	abstract = {Radiologic screening of high-risk adults reduces lung-cancer-related mortality1,2; however, a small minority of eligible individuals undergo such screening in the United States3,4. The availability of blood-based tests could increase screening uptake. Here we introduce improvements to cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq)5, a method for the analysis of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), to better facilitate screening applications. We show that, although levels are very low in early-stage lung cancers, ctDNA is present prior to treatment in most patients and its presence is strongly prognostic. We also find that the majority of somatic mutations in the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of patients with lung cancer and of risk-matched controls reflect clonal haematopoiesis and are non-recurrent. Compared with tumour-derived mutations, clonal haematopoiesis mutations occur on longer cfDNA fragments and lack mutational signatures that are associated with tobacco smoking. Integrating these findings with other molecular features, we develop and prospectively validate a machine-learning method termed ‘lung cancer likelihood in plasma’ (Lung-CLiP), which can robustly discriminate early-stage lung cancer patients from risk-matched controls. This approach achieves performance similar to that of tumour-informed ctDNA detection and enables tuning of assay specificity in order to facilitate distinct clinical applications. Our findings establish the potential of cfDNA for lung cancer screening and highlight the importance of risk-matching cases and controls in cfDNA-based screening studies.},

	abstract = {From a cancer registry in the San Francisco Bay area we obtained survival data for 2,495 women diagnosed with breast cancer at ages 55–64. We relate mortality among these women to the time since diagnosis and to the stage of the disease at diagnosis. We divide the study period, extending through 10 years, into five two-year periods, and for each stage we assume a constant hazard rate during each of these periods. Let λ = (λ jk ) be the J × K matrix of hazard rates for the J = 5 periods and K = 5 stages. The most general model allows λ jk to vary freely. A plot of maximum likelihood estimates of the hazard rates shows some tendency for increase with stage, but no simple patterns or parallelism across stage. We seek more restrictive models, to get simpler interpretations. The exponential model assumes that although λ jk may vary with stage, it is constant over the five periods for each stage. This model, which assumes no dependence of hazard rate on time since diagnosis, is quite restrictive, and indeed the likelihood ratio test of the exponential versus the general model rejects it strongly. Not quite as restrictive as the exponential model is a proportional-hazards model, which assumes that the log-hazard rates for the first four stages are parallel. Nevertheless, the likelihood ratio test of this model versus the general model rejects it as well. We explore the possibility that one of the more restrictive models is appropriate but that the bad fit is due to errors in staging. To do so, we replace the aforementioned models with ones that accommodate stage misclassification. Using the EM algorithm to compute maximum likelihood estimates and likelihood ratio statistics, we find that the exponential model is again rejected, but that the proportional-hazards model fits the data. This example shows that simple models with straightforward interpretations might be discarded needlessly if covariate misclassifications are ignored. Simulations support this possibility. When data are generated according to a proportional-hazards model with stage misclassifications, ignoring the misclassification can result in missing the proportional-hazards model. Simulations revealed other points. In particular, large samples are needed to detect classification errors. In addition, misclassification models give hazard-rate estimates that can be much more variable than those of models without misclassification.},

	abstract = {CDK4/6 inhibitors represent a new treatment standard for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative advanced breast cancer (BC) patients. Although efficacious, resistance to these agents is universal. Here, we profiled a large panel of HR+ BC cell lines with conditioned resistance to the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, and analyzed cell cycle-related markers by gene expression profiles (GEP) and western blot (WB). GEP showed high molecular heterogeneity among the models, with E2F targets being significantly enriched both during treatment and at the time of resistance. By both WB and GEP, a common molecular feature at the time of palbociclib resistance was the concomitant overexpression of cyclin E1 and down-regulation of Rb. CCNE1 was the only significantly up-regulated gene among E2F targets at resistance with CCNE1 genomic amplification being observed in two resistant models. Rb was downregulated in all resistant models; a reduction of RB1 copy number was observed in three resistant cell lines. In silico analyses showed that CCNE1/RB1 ratio correlated with palbociclib IC50 in different datasets of both breast and non-breast cancer cell lines, performing better than CCNE1 or RB1 taken separately. Finally, the CCNE1/RB1 ratio was shown to be an adverse prognostic factor in patients with ER+ BC and to be able to discriminate palbociclib-sensitive versus resistant among patients enrolled in the NeoPalAna trial, a neoadjuvant trial testing palbociclib, performing better than CCNE1 or RB1 alone. Our data suggest that the CCNE1/RB1 ratio may be a viable biomarker of palbociclib resistance, warranting further clinical validation., The expression levels of two genes involved in controlling the cell cycle offers a promising predictive indicator of whether women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer are likely to develop resistance to the drug palbociclib. A team led by Luca Malorni and Ilenia Migliaccio from the Hospital of Prato, Italy, analyzed gene and protein profiles in a panel of breast cancer cell lines with differential sensitivity to palbociclib. The researchers found that, compared to palbociclib-sensitive cell lines, those that were drug-resistant tended to have elevated expression of one cell-cycle–related gene, called CCNE1, and reduced expression of another, called Rb. The ratio of CCNE1:Rb expression proved to be an accurate prognostic factor among patients enrolled in a clinical trial of palbociclib, performing better than either CCNE1 or Rb levels on their own.},

Since immune cells represent a large fraction of the TME, they play a key role in mediating pro- and anti-tumor immune responses. Immune escape, which suppresses anti-tumor immunity, enables tumor cells to maintain their proliferation and growth. Numerous mechanisms, which have been intensively studied in recent years, are involved in this process and based on these findings, novel immunotherapies have been successfully developed. Here, we review the composition of the TME and the mechanisms by which immune evasive processes are regulated. In detail, we describe membrane-bound and soluble factors, their regulation, and their impact on immune cell activation in the TME. Furthermore, we give an overview of the tumor/antigen presentation and how it is influenced under malignant conditions. Finally, we summarize novel TME-targeting agents, which are already in clinical trials for different tumor entities.},

There are no less than 2500 differentially-expressed genes, which lead to power-like tails in the expression distribution functions. 3) Tumors in different localizations share hundreds or even thousands of differentially expressed genes. There are 6 genes common to the 15 studied tumor localizations. 4) The tumor region is a kind of attractor. Tumors in advanced stages converge to this region independently of patient age or genetic variability. 5) There is a landscape of cancer in gene expression space with an approximate border separating normal tissues from tumors.},

	abstract = {Cancer is driven by distinctive sorts of changes and basic variations in genes. Recognizing cancer driver genes is basic for accurate oncological analysis. Numerous methodologies to distinguish and identify drivers presently exist, but efficient tools to combine and optimize them on huge datasets are few. Most strategies for prioritizing transformations depend basically on frequency-based criteria. Strategies are required to dependably prioritize organically dynamic driver changes over inert passengers in high-throughput sequencing cancer information sets. This study proposes a model namely PCDG-Pred which works as a utility capable of distinguishing cancer driver and passenger attributes of genes based on sequencing data. Keeping in view the significance of the cancer driver genes an efficient method is proposed to identify the cancer driver genes. Further, various validation techniques are applied at different levels to establish the effectiveness of the model and to obtain metrics like accuracy, Mathew’s correlation coefficient, sensitivity, and specificity. The results of the study strongly indicate that the proposed strategy provides a fundamental functional advantage over other existing strategies for cancer driver genes identification. Subsequently, careful experiments exhibit that the accuracy metrics obtained for self-consistency, independent set, and cross-validation tests are 91.08\%., 87.26\%, and 92.48\% respectively.},

	abstract = {Gene Expression is the process of determining the physical characteristics of living beings by generating the necessary proteins. Gene Expression takes place in two steps, translation and transcription. It is the flow of information from DNA to RNA with enzymes’ help, and the end product is proteins and other biochemical molecules. Many technologies can capture Gene Expression from the DNA or RNA. One such technique is Microarray DNA. Other than being expensive, the main issue with Microarray DNA is that it generates high-dimensional data with minimal sample size. The issue in handling such a heavyweight dataset is that the learning model will be over-fitted. This problem should be addressed by reducing the dimension of the data source to a considerable amount. In recent years, Machine Learning has gained popularity in the field of genomic studies. In the literature, many Machine Learning-based Gene Selection approaches have been discussed, which were proposed to improve dimensionality reduction precision. This paper does an extensive review of the various works done on Machine Learning-based gene selection in recent years, along with its performance analysis. The study categorizes various feature selection algorithms under Supervised, Unsupervised, and Semi-supervised learning. The works done in recent years to reduce the features for diagnosing tumors are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the performance of several discussed methods in the literature is analyzed. This study also lists out and briefly discusses the open issues in handling the high-dimension and less sample size data.},

One specific problem is that results vary depending on statistical method employed and it has been argued that triangulation of multiple methods is advantageous to safely identify the correct, important variables. To date, no formal method of triangulation has been reported that incorporates both model stability and coefficient estimates; in this paper we develop an adaptable, straightforward method to achieve this. Six methods of variable selection were evaluated using simulated datasets of different dimensions with known underlying relationships. We used a bootstrap methodology to combine stability matrices across methods and estimate aggregated coefficient distributions. Novel graphical approaches provided a transparent route to visualise and compare results between methods. The proposed aggregated method provides a flexible route to formally triangulate results across any chosen number of variable selection methods and provides a combined result that incorporates uncertainty arising from between-method variability. In these simulated datasets, the combined method generally performed as well or better than the individual methods, with low error rates and clearer demarcation of the true causal variables than for the individual methods.},

Several internal validation methods are available that aim to provide a more accurate estimate of model performance in new subjects. We evaluated several variants of split-sample, cross-validation and bootstrapping methods with a logistic regression model that included eight predictors for 30-day mortality after an acute myocardial infarction. Random samples with a size between n = 572 and n = 9165 were drawn from a large data set (GUSTO-I; n = 40,830; 2851 deaths) to reflect modeling in data sets with between 5 and 80 events per variable. Independent performance was determined on the remaining subjects. Performance measures included discriminative ability, calibration and overall accuracy. We found that split-sample analyses gave overly pessimistic estimates of performance, with large variability. Cross-validation on 10\% of the sample had low bias and low variability, but was not suitable for all performance measures. Internal validity could best be estimated with bootstrapping, which provided stable estimates with low bias. We conclude that split-sample validation is inefficient, and recommend bootstrapping for estimation of internal validity of a predictive logistic regression model.},

Here we discuss bootstrap estimates of prediction error, which can be thought of as smoothed versions of cross-validation. We show that a particular bootstrap method, the .632+ rule, substantially outperforms cross-validation in a catalog of 24 simulation experiments. Besides providing point estimates, we also consider estimating the variability of an error rate estimate. All of the results here are nonparametric and apply to any possible prediction rule; however, we study only classification problems with 0–1 loss in detail.

	abstract = {PURPOSE

Biomarkers that can predict response to anti–programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) therapy across multiple tumor types include a T-cell–inflamed gene-expression profile (GEP), programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, and tumor mutational burden (TMB). Associations between these biomarkers and the clinical efficacy of pembrolizumab were evaluated in a clinical trial that encompassed 20 cohorts of patients with advanced solid tumors.

METHODS

KEYNOTE-028 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02054806) is a nonrandomized, phase Ib trial that enrolled 475 patients with PD-L1–positive advanced solid tumors who were treated with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 2 years or until confirmed disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR; by RECIST v1.1, investigator review). Secondary end points included safety, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Relationships between T-cell–inflamed GEP, PD-L1 expression, and TMB and antitumor activity were exploratory end points.

RESULTS

ORRs (with 95\% CIs) ranged from 0\% (0.0\% to 14.2\%) in pancreatic cancer to 33\% (15.6\% to 55.3\%) in small-cell lung cancer. Across cohorts, median (95\% CI) PFS ranged from 1.7 months (1.5 to 2.9 months) to 6.8 months (1.9 to 14.1 months) in pancreatic and thyroid cancers, respectively, and median OS from 3.9 months (2.8 to 5.5 months) to 21.1 months (9.1 to 22.4 months) in vulvar and carcinoid tumors, respectively. Higher response rates and longer PFS were demonstrated in tumors with higher T-cell–inflamed GEP, PD-L1 expression, and/or TMB. Correlations of TMB with GEP and PD-L1 were low. Response patterns indicate that patients with tumors that had high levels of both TMB and inflammatory markers (GEP or PD-L1) represent a population with the highest likelihood of response. Safety was similar and consistent with prior pembrolizumab reports.

CONCLUSION

A T-cell–-inflamed GEP, PD-L1 expression, and TMB predicted response to pembrolizumab in multiple tumor types. These biomarkers (alone/in combination) may help identify patients who have a higher likelihood of response to anti–PD-1 therapies across a broad spectrum of cancers.},

To explore this immune phenotype within and across tumor types, we applied the TIS algorithm to over 9000 tumor gene expression profiles downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). As expected based on prior evidence, tumors with known clinical sensitivity to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade had higher average TIS scores. Furthermore, TIS scores were more variable within than between tumor types, and within each tumor type a subset of patients with elevated scores was identifiable although with different prevalence associated with each tumor type, the latter consistent with the observed clinical responsiveness to anti PD-1 blockade. Notably, TIS scores only minimally correlated with mutation load in most tumors and ranking tumors by median TIS score showed differing association to clinical sensitivity to PD-1/PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade than ranking of the same tumors by mutation load. The expression patterns of the TIS algorithm genes were conserved across tumor types yet appeared to be minimally prognostic in most cancers, consistent with the TIS score serving as a pan-cancer measurement of the inflamed tumor phenotype. Characterization of the prevalence and variability of TIS will lead to increased understanding of the immune status of untreated tumors and may lead to improved indication selection for testing immunotherapy agents.},

	abstract = {Large-scale in vitro drug sensitivity screens are an important tool in personalized oncology to predict the effectiveness of potential cancer drugs. The prediction of the sensitivity of cancer cell lines to a panel of drugs is a multivariate regression problem with high dimensional heterogeneous multiomics data as input data and with potentially strong correlations between the outcome variables which represent the sensitivity to the different drugs. We propose a joint penalized regression approach with structured penalty terms which enable us to utilize the correlation structure between drugs with group-lasso-type penalties and at the same time address the heterogeneity between ‘omics’ data sources by introducing data-source-specific penalty factors to penalize different data sources differently. By combining integrative penalty factors (IPFs) with the tree-guided group lasso, we create a method called ‘IPF-tree-lasso’. We present a unified framework to transform more general IPF-type methods to the original penalized method. Because the structured penalty terms have multiple parameters, we demonstrate how the interval search ‘Efficient parameter selection via global optimization’ algorithm can be used to optimize multiple penalty parameters efficiently. Simulation studies show that IPF-tree-lasso can improve the prediction performance compared with other lasso-type methods, in particular for heterogeneous sources of data. Finally, we employ the new methods to analyse data from the ‘Genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer’ project.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces stacked generalization, a scheme for minimizing the generalization error rate of one or more generalizers. Stacked generalization works by deducing the biases of the generalizer(s) with respect to a provided learning set. This deduction proceeds by generalizing in a second space whose inputs are (for example) the guesses of the original generalizers when taught with part of the learning set and trying to guess the rest of it, and whose output is (for example) the correct guess. When used with multiple generalizers, stacked generalization can be seen as a more sophisticated version of cross-validation, exploiting a strategy more sophisticated than cross-validation's crude winner-takes-all for combining the individual generalizers. When used with a single generalizer, stacked generalization is a scheme for estimating (and then correcting for) the error of a generalizer which has been trained on a particular learning set and then asked a particular question. After introducing stacked generalization and justifying its use, this paper presents two numerical experiments. The first demonstrates how stacked generalization improves upon a set of separate generalizers for the NETtalk task of translating text to phonemes. The second demonstrates how stacked generalization improves the performance of a single surface-fitter. With the other experimental evidence in the literature, the usual arguments supporting cross-validation, and the abstract justifications presented in this paper, the conclusion is that for almost any real-world generalization problem one should use some version of stacked generalization to minimize the generalization error rate. This paper ends by discussing some of the variations of stacked generalization, and how it touches on other fields like chaos theory.},

Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

Even though immune-based therapies are more likely to achieve complete cures, acquired resistance remains an obstacle to their success as well. Acquired resistance is the direct consequence of pre-existing intratumor heterogeneity and ongoing diversification during therapy, which enables some tumor cells to survive treatment and facilitates the development of new therapy-resistant phenotypes. In this review, we discuss the sources of intratumor heterogeneity and approaches to capture and account for it during clinical decision making.

Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases (18.1 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) occurred in 2020. Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7\%), followed by lung (11.4\%), colorectal (10.0 \%), prostate (7.3\%), and stomach (5.6\%) cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18\%), followed by colorectal (9.4\%), liver (8.3\%), stomach (7.7\%), and female breast (6.9\%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2-fold to 3-fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied {\textless}2-fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47\% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64\% to 95\%) versus transitioned (32\% to 56\%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy. Efforts to build a sustainable infrastructure for the dissemination of cancer prevention measures and provision of cancer care in transitioning countries is critical for global cancer control.},

In linear models, Lasso (or \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$-regularized) regression assigns zero weights to the most irrelevant or redundant features, and is widely used in data science. However the Lasso only applies to linear models. Here we introduce LassoNet, a neural network framework with global feature selection. Our approach enforces a hierarchy: specifically a feature can participate in a hidden unit only if its linear representative is active. Unlike other approaches to feature selection for neural nets, our method uses a modified objective function with constraints, and so integrates feature selection with the parameter learning directly. As a result, it delivers an entire regularization path of solutions with a range of feature sparsity. On systematic experiments, LassoNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for feature selection and regression. The LassoNet method uses projected proximal gradient descent, and generalizes directly to deep networks. It can be implemented by adding just a few lines of code to a standard neural network.},

	abstract = {In the last two decades, there have been massive advancements in high throughput technologies, which resulted in the exponential growth of public repositories of gene expression datasets for various phenotypes. It is possible to unravel biomarkers by comparing the gene expression levels under different conditions, such as disease vs. control, treated vs. not treated, drug A vs. drug B, etc. This problem refers to a well-studied problem in the machine learning domain, i.e., the feature selection problem. In biological data analysis, most of the computational feature selection methodologies were taken from other fields, without considering the nature of the biological data. Thus, integrative approaches that utilize the biological knowledge while performing feature selection are necessary for this kind of data. The main idea behind the integrative gene selection process is to generate a ranked list of genes considering both the statistical metrics that are applied to the gene expression data, and the biological background information which is provided as external datasets. One of the main goals of this review is to explore the existing methods that integrate different types of information in order to improve the identification of the biomolecular signatures of diseases and the discovery of new potential targets for treatment. These integrative approaches are expected to aid the prediction, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases, as well as to enlighten us on disease state dynamics, mechanisms of their onset and progression. The integration of various types of biological information will necessitate the development of novel techniques for integration and data analysis. Another aim of this review is to boost the bioinformatics community to develop new approaches for searching and determining significant groups/clusters of features based on one or more biological grouping functions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The four intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer, defined by differential expression of 50 genes (PAM50), have been shown to be predictive of risk of recurrence and benefit of hormonal therapy and chemotherapy. Here we describe the development of Prosigna™, a PAM50-based subtype classifier and risk model on the NanoString nCounter Dx Analysis System intended for decentralized testing in clinical laboratories.
METHODS: 514 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast cancer patient samples were used to train prototypical centroids for each of the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer on the NanoString platform. Hierarchical cluster analysis of gene expression data was used to identify the prototypical centroids defined in previous PAM50 algorithm training exercises. 304 FFPE patient samples from a well annotated clinical cohort in the absence of adjuvant systemic therapy were then used to train a subtype-based risk model (i.e. Prosigna ROR score). 232 samples from a tamoxifen-treated patient cohort were used to verify the prognostic accuracy of the algorithm prior to initiating clinical validation studies.
RESULTS: The gene expression profiles of each of the four Prosigna subtype centroids were consistent with those previously published using the PCR-based PAM50 method. Similar to previously published classifiers, tumor samples classified as Luminal A by Prosigna had the best prognosis compared to samples classified as one of the three higher-risk tumor subtypes. The Prosigna Risk of Recurrence (ROR) score model was verified to be significantly associated with prognosis as a continuous variable and to add significant information over both commonly available IHC markers and Adjuvant! Online.
CONCLUSIONS: The results from the training and verification data sets show that the FDA-cleared and CE marked Prosigna test provides an accurate estimate of the risk of distant recurrence in hormone receptor positive breast cancer and is also capable of identifying a tumor's intrinsic subtype that is consistent with the previously published PCR-based PAM50 assay. Subsequent analytical and clinical validation studies confirm the clinical accuracy and technical precision of the Prosigna PAM50 assay in a decentralized setting.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease with multiple subtypes. The classification of these subtypes has evolved over the years. The most common and widely accepted classification of breast cancer is from an immunohistochemical perspective, based on the expression of the following hormone receptors: estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and human epidermal growth factor (HER2). Accordingly, the following four subtypes of breast cancer are widely recognized: luminal A, luminal B, HER2-positive, and triple-negative. With the recent advances in cancer research, and an increased molecular understanding of breast cancer, the current clinical model for classification of breast cancer may be benefit from the addition of several molecular markers such as miRNAs (let-7, miR-155, miR-150, miR-153) and mutations (p53, BRCA 1 and 2 genes). This chapter provides an overview of the characteristics of these four subtypes of breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Feature Selection and Functional Data Analysis are two dynamic areas of research, with important applications in the analysis of large and complex data sets. Straddling these two areas, we propose a new highly efficient algorithm to perform Group Elastic Net with application to function-on-scalar feature selection, where a functional response is modeled against a very large number of potential scalar predictors. First, we introduce a new algorithm to solve Group Elastic Net in ultra-high dimensional settings, which exploits the sparsity structure of the Augmented Lagrangian to greatly reduce the computational burden. Next, taking advantage of the properties of Functional Principal Components, we extend our algorithm to the function-on-scalar regression framework. We use simulations to demonstrate the CPU time gains afforded by our approach compared to its best existing competitors, and present an application to data from a Genome-Wide Association Study on childhood obesity.},
